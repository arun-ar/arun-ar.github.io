### Down the Rabbit-Hole
It all started with an article in a weekly Tamil magazine. An article that took me down the rabbit-hole into the Leader-land.

It was the fifth year of my work career and I was asked to take up a lead role to architect and deliver a project. Being new to the role and also feeling accountable for a team, I wanted to ensure that I don't fail. I started to look around with the hope of finding a secret formula to lead people. Something didn't feel right with the styles that I saw. Either the lead was imitating a teacher or a parent, with whom most of us grew up or a king, about whom we heard stories. I, somehow, didn't feel these styles would work in the long run.

That article, in the Tamil weekly, was about Southwest Airlines, which was pioneering & successful in a very competitive market, and its President Colleen Barrett. I found the article very peculiar. Very peculiar to find the line 'Lead with LUV'. How could someone lead with love ? Aren't they mutually exclusive ?  This got me very curious - a curious thirst to unravel the elusive.

### Peculiar Story , What's love gotta do ...?
In the following week, I rushed to my office library, hoping to find the book. And there it was - my portal to leader-verse. 

I found stories about how customer-facing employees were given more freedom to take responsible decisions. A story wherein a flight staff who allowed a well known book author to board the aircraft understanding the difficult situation of the author who didn't have any id proof. Another story wherein a suggestion to remove the company logo on garbage bags from a ground employee led to very significant savings. Also a story where the company didn't apologize to rude customers, putting their employees first. When asked about losing those customers, Colleen Barrett, cheekily, replied, 'We share those rude customers with our competitors' :)  

### Nutsy & the Gutsy
Having tasted 'Lead with LUV', my mind got even more itchy. I found another book on Southwest in my office library. It was aptly named 'NUTS'. 

NUTS also told the founding story of SouthWest Airlines and their crazily good way of leadership. One of the reasons the book was named so because Southwest was then serving just peanuts onboard.

Like most of the successful books, I found the authors had made a sequel - named 'GUTS' (courtesy, of course, office library). It had the stories of few organisations that followed unique ways like Southwest to lead people and yet consistently successful.  One organization stood out in craziness - Semco. 

### The mad man and his company
'Employees set their own salaries' - Believe me, its true. "GUTS" had the story of Semco - the company that let their employees set their own salaries. And the mad good man running that company was Ricardo Semler. 

I found the company had no HR or secretaries but more shockingly surprising was the fact that there were no managers too. It was hard to believe. I was so curious since it was like - I could smell the secret sauce. 

### The Maverick and his 7 day weekend 
My trips to library after my lunch breaks became a regular routine. To my surprise, I found two books 'Maverick and Seven-day Weekend' written by Ricardo Semler. True to the book's title Semler was a Maverick - an unorthodox in every way when it comes to leading people. He is the only leader that I admire in the corporate world until now.

Maverick is the story about how Semler slowly and steadily transformed Semco into a truly democratic organisation. For the first time, I came to know of the words 'corporate democracy'. Somehow it never occurred to me that democracy can be employed in a company. May be because of that infamous line that we were all repeatedly told from our infancy (in the corporate world) that ' you can't choose your Boss'. Semler questions, ' If a well grown adult can choose his/her political leader who rules them, why can't he/she choose his/her immediate leader'. It sounded very logical to me in a world where nations go to war to establish democracy in far off continents. 

Semler also tells how wrong it is for leaders to treat their employees like children. They tend to become protective and possessive. How hate and shock engulf those leaders when their team members commit a mistake or ask for a change. Semler advocates leaders to treat employees like adults by giving due respect to their well grown brains. In this information world where holding information is power, dissemination of information to all employees empowers them to take informed decisions especially information w.r.t their company's finances which is a key gives true democracy. I know a lot of scenarios pop up in your mind that you feel this won't work but you got to read his books where you would find stories where all those scenarios are answered. 

One line from the book that I often tell my team is "It's better to ask sorry than to ask permission". There's lots to tell about this guy but I will leave it to your curiousness. For a sneak preview, check out [his TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/ricardo_semler_how_to_run_a_company_with_almost_no_rules). 

### Leader and the Servant 
In my quest, I found a style appearing in many instances.  - Servant Leadership, pop up in most of the stories. When I ran through the leadership shelves of my office library, I stumbled upon 
James Hunter's 'The World's Most Powerful Leadership Principle' and 'Winning with People' by John Maxwell. Reading both, I got a good understanding of Servant Leadership.

These two books reveal that we have real life servant leaders - our Mothers who hold complete authority over us by diligently serving us. The way she balances kindness and punishment and the way we completely surrender to her authority. As I told earlier, only place it lacks is treating children as adults after a point.

Another revelation that I had via the books is that on 'Why your Leader can't never be your Mentor ?'. A Leader always tries to make a replica of himself and unconsciously evaluates their team using the same criteria. Also a leader will try to utilize your skills in a way that the team's goal is achieved - more like a team Captain. A Mentor is someone who tries to see your skills and guide you to pursue in that path even if it means to leave the team or company - more like a Coach.

The main revelation from Servant Leadership that will guide me for the rest of my career and life is this. 

>Love (= Leadership) is 
>is patient. 
>is kind.
>does not envy.
>does not boast.
>is not proud.
>does not dishonour others.
>is not self-seeking.
>is not easily angered.
>keeps no record of wrongs.
>does not delight in evil.
>rejoices with the truth.
>always protects.
>always trusts.
>always hopes.
>always perseveres." 
> - Corianthians  13:4-7
  
This biblical quote as-is applies to Leadership.  

### How to deliver happiness 
Having gone far into the leader-land, I found the lead-verse conspiring to reveal more of itself when I got the book 'Delivering Happiness' by Tony Hsieh as a birthday gift from a office friend. It had the story of Tony and his company named Zappos that delivers shoes online. Tony emphasized more to the culture of the organisation. 
Zappos was a consistently successful company that was later bought by Amazon. Tony places high importance to people and culture of the organisation. 

And this book is the rabbit hole for my next journey which is into the 'Happiness-Land'. But that's for another day...
