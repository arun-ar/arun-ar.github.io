### Rabbit Hole
It all started with a weekly Tamil magazine. An article that served like a rabbit hole for my journey into the Leaderland.

It was the fifth year of my IT career and I was asked to take up a lead role to deliver a JavaEE project, in addition to architecting it. Being new to the role and also feeling accountable for a team, I wanted to ensure that I don't fail. I started to look around for leadership styles. Something didn't feel right with those styles that I saw. It was mostly command-and-control style which I, somehow,  didn't feel would work in the long run. 

### Peculiar Story
The article was on a peculiar story of a company that was successful & pioneering in a very competitive market. The peculiar thing for me was the statement "Lead with LUV". The company referred in the article was Southwest and it was a gist from the book "Lead with LUV" by Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett. In the following week day, I went to the office library and grabbed the book. 

### Nutsy & the Gutsy
This book on SouthWest Airlines led me to another book named 'NUTS'. NUTS was also the story of SouthWest Airlines and their crazy way of leadership. One of the reasons the book was named so because Southwest was then serving peanuts onboard, aptly, as a low cost carrier.

Like Bahubali, there was a second part for this book - named 'GUTS' (courtesy, of course, office library). It had the stories of organisations that followed unique leadership styles like Southwest and yet consistently successful. 

### Employees set their own salaries
Believe me. Its true. There is an organisation where employees set their own salaries. And "GUTS" had the story of that company as one of their stories. Semco was the company and Ricardo Semler was the crazy successful CEO. 

### The Maverick and his 7 day weekend 
Maverick and Seven day Weekend are the books by Ricardo Semler. True to the book's title Semler was a maverick - unorthodox in every way when it comes to to leadership. Only leader that I admire in the corporate world until now. 

Maverick is the story about Semco company and how Semler slowly and steadily transformed it into a truly democratic organisation. For the first time, I came to know the words 'corporate democracy'. First time, someone say "you can't choose your boss" needn't be always true. First time, someone question that when nations are waging for establishing democracy, why so not in a corporate. First time some one say "Its better to ask sorry than to ask permission". 

### Leader and the Servant 
Two words were popping up in most of the stories - Servant Leadership. When I skimmed through the leadership shelves of my office library, I stumbled upon 
James Hunter's 'The World's Most Powerful Leadership Principle' and 'Winning_with_People' by John Maxwell. Both gave me deep understanding of the Servant Leadership and how to treat people as people and not as resources.

### How to deliver happiness 
Since I was deep down in the rabbit hole, the leaderland universe was conspiring to reveal more of itself by having my office friend gift me a book - 'Delivering Happiness' by Tony hsieh, for my birthday. This book was on Tony telling story and his company named Zappos that delivers shoes online. Zappos was a consistently successful company that was later bought by Amazon. Tony places high importance to people and culture of the organisation. 

And this book is the rabbit hole for my next journey into the 'HappinessLand'. But that's for another day...
