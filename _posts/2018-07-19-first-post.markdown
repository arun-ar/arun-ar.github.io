>There is a myth, sometimes widespread, that a person need only do inner work...that a man is entirely responsible for his own problems; and that to cure himself, he need only change himself....The fact is, a person is so formed by his surroundings, that his state of harmony depends entirely on his harmony with his surroundings.
> ~ Christopher Alexander

**"Probably the girl wouldn't have jumped if it was open"** I said to my office friends during an evening chat. To which one of them replied , "That was the first thing I feared when I stepped into this office premises. No common-sensical person will build in such a way". 

We were actually talking about the closed corridor and the girl who committed suicide by jumping from 9th floor corridor, a few weeks back. 

We work in the new building that is right opposite to the dump yard and right next to a large marsh land. This 12 storey IT facility looks like a closed box with hollow squarical area in the centre with the roof closed. So there are corridors for people to walk in and out of offices but closed to outside world of Sun or Air. 

This incident happened two weeks back. Police came. The area was cleaned up within few hours with no trace. No official announcement were made to other people. No official mourning. Nothing. The next day, a newspaper reported that the girl committed suicide because of her personal problems related to marriage. 

Probably her personal situation could have been the main reason but as Christopher Alexander says "*a person is so formed by his surroundings, that her state of harmony depends entirely on her harmony with her surroundings*". And I strongly believe in that. Especially on the need for Open corridors/Open spaces within buildings. If a human continuously stays inside closed areas, he/she gets more stressed. When one comes out in the open, in the corridor or balcony, then he/she feels bit relaxed. To simply put, "when there is no roof above you, you will feel relaxed.". 

'No common-sensical person will...', it still rings in my mind. Not sure when Builders will get common-sensical with respect to people's lives.
